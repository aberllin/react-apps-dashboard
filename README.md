**MacOS-like Desktop on the web**	:desktop_computer:

It's a replica of the desktop and window management experience in macOS. There is a working dock; windows can be opened from the dock, moved around, resized, maximized, and minimized. 

There are two working applications:
  * Todo App, where you can write down your todos, edit them, delete or mark as DONE. They are stores at local storage.
  * GitHub Search app, which is an app to find user by login, allows adding to Favorite list.
